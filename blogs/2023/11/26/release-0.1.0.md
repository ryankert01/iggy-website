## Release notes

The **streaming server**, being the core of the project, has been improved in many ways. Some of the most important features and bug fixes have to do with the area of memory management, such as keeping the configurable size of the cache under control, extended security including the authentication and authorization, added personal access tokens, and the overall stability of the server.

All the core components (server + SDK + CLI + bench) have to go through a lot of automated tests on the different OS, which are run on every commit, and the code coverage is constantly increasing. We've put a lot of offert into making our CI/CD pipeline as robust as possible, and we are happy with the results.

On top of it, the built-in benchmarking application has been significantly improved and now has its own CLI tool, which makes it easier to use.

Additionally, we've also a great **CLI** being actively developed, which purpose is to allow the users to interact with the server using the command line.

And then there's a modern, responsive, and fast **Web UI**, which provides a way to interact with the server using the browser.

While Rust **SDK** is the most mature one, and the C# is a close second, the remaining ones for Java, Go, Python, and NodeJS are catching up. It's not an easy task to keep all of them in sync, but we are doing our best to make sure that the SDKs are up-to-date with the latest changes in the server.

Last but not least, we are **extremely grateful to the community**, which is growing every day. We are getting more and more feedback, and we are doing our best to address all the issues and feature requests. We are also getting more and more contributions, which is a great sign that the project is going in the right direction.
