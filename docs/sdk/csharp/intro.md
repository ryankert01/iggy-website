The Iggy SDK for C# is a modern, async-first client library for interacting with an Iggy message streaming server from your .NET applications. It supports TCP and HTTP transports. The package is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Iggy/) and the source code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/foreign/csharp).

The SDK is built around the `IIggyClient` interface, which aggregates every feature (publishing, consuming, stream/topic management, users, offsets, consumer groups, and system operations). For the low-level per-call API and the full configuration reference, see the [Guide](/docs/sdk/csharp/guide). For the ergonomic, batteries-included producer/consumer abstractions, see the [High-level SDK](/docs/sdk/csharp/high-level-sdk).

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Apache.Iggy --prerelease
```

The SDK targets .NET 8 and .NET 10 (`net8.0` and `net10.0`). Stable versions on NuGet stop at `0.8.0`, which predates the current wire protocol and cannot talk to a current server. The `0.9.0` line ships as **prerelease versions** (`0.9.0-edge.x` at the time of writing), so `--prerelease` is required.

## Supported protocols

The SDK supports two transport protocols:

- **TCP** - binary protocol for optimal performance and lower latency (recommended). Over TCP the SDK speaks the VSR consensus framing, the only wire protocol the server accepts. See [Connection semantics](#connection-semantics)
- **HTTP** - RESTful JSON API for stateless operations. `BaseAddress` must then be a full URI such as `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (the server's default HTTP port is 3000, TCP is 8090)

Some operations are **TCP-only** and throw `FeatureUnavailableException` on HTTP: joining/leaving a consumer group, `GetMeAsync`, `DeleteSegmentsAsync`, and `SendBinaryRequestAsync`.

## Connection semantics

Over TCP every request is wrapped in a 256-byte consensus header (Viewstamped Replication), the client registers a consensus session at login, and writes are replicated before they are acknowledged. The `IIggyClient` surface is unchanged. What changes is the behavior around connections, groups, and failures:

- **Login binds a session.** `LoginUserAsync` / `LoginWithPersonalAccessTokenAsync` run the register handshake, and the session lives for as long as the connection. Logging out, being evicted, or losing the connection ends it, and the next login registers a fresh one.
- **Leader redirection is automatic.** The client reads the cluster roster, follows the current leader, and re-checks it when a request is refused because the node stopped being primary. `GetCurrentAddress()` reports the node the client currently talks to.
- **The client picks partitions.** Balanced and message-key partitioning are resolved client-side (the message-key hash matches the Rust SDK byte for byte), and consumer-group polls round-robin over the partitions the coordinator assigned to this client.
- **Consumer groups are assignment-based.** `JoinConsumerGroupAsync` makes this client a member. The assignment is synced on demand and refreshed on every `PingAsync`. The TCP client pings on its own every `HeartbeatInterval` (5 seconds by default), so an idle session survives the server's heartbeat verification and assignments stay fresh.
- **Credentials are bounds-checked locally.** A username outside 3-50 bytes, a password outside 3-100 bytes, or a personal access token outside 1-255 bytes is rejected before the request is framed.
- **Consumer offsets need an explicit partition.** `StoreOffsetAsync` / `DeleteOffsetAsync` do not accept a `null` partition id under VSR. Passing one throws client-side.
- **Polling a topic that does not exist returns an empty poll** rather than throwing. The server answers an unresolved topic with the empty-poll reply shape, so the client cannot tell it apart from a topic with no messages. Check the topic exists first if the distinction matters.

### Failed requests

The SDK replays a request whenever the server says it never admitted it. Two exceptions surface to the caller:

- `IggyInvalidStatusCodeException` carries the server status code, with `FromServer` telling apart a verdict the cluster reported from a failure the client raised itself.
- `VsrRequestOutcomeUnknownException` means no server verdict arrived after the request was written (the connection was lost, the call was cancelled, or the server evicted the session mid-flight), so the cluster may or may not have committed it. The SDK will not replay it on a new session, because that would bypass server-side deduplication. Re-issuing it is **the caller's decision**.

The high-level abstractions handle the unknown-outcome case differently:

- `IggyConsumer` rethrows it rather than swallowing it, because an auto-committing poll may already have advanced the offset. Rethrowing ends the polling loop, so catch it around the enumeration, decide whether the operation is safe to re-issue, and start consuming again:

  ```csharp
  while (!token.IsCancellationRequested)
  {
      try
      {
          await foreach (var message in consumer.ReceiveAsync(token))
          {
              Process(message);
          }
      }
      catch (VsrRequestOutcomeUnknownException)
      {
          // The last poll may or may not have committed. Decide whether
          // re-polling is safe for this workload, then resume the loop.
      }
  }
  ```

- `IggyPublisher` with background sending does not retry it: the batch is reported through the message-batch-failed event (`SubscribeOnMessageBatchFailed`), typed so a subscriber can tell "not sent" from "possibly sent twice". Direct (non-background) sends throw it to the caller.

## Creating a client

Create a client with `IggyClientFactory.CreateClient`, then call `ConnectAsync`:

```csharp
using Apache.Iggy.Configuration;
using Apache.Iggy.Enums;
using Apache.Iggy.Factory;

var client = IggyClientFactory.CreateClient(new IggyClientConfigurator
{
    BaseAddress = "127.0.0.1:8090",
    Protocol = Protocol.Tcp
});

await client.ConnectAsync();
await client.LoginUserAsync("iggy", "iggy");
```

Optionally, provide an `ILoggerFactory` for diagnostics (defaults to `NullLoggerFactory.Instance`):

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>
{
    builder
        .AddFilter("Apache.Iggy", LogLevel.Information)
        .AddConsole();
});

var client = IggyClientFactory.CreateClient(new IggyClientConfigurator
{
    BaseAddress = "127.0.0.1:8090",
    Protocol = Protocol.Tcp,
    LoggerFactory = loggerFactory
});
```

`IggyClientConfigurator` also exposes buffer sizes, TLS, the heartbeat interval, the maximum response frame size, automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (on by default), auto-login (so you can skip the explicit `LoginUserAsync` call), and client-side message encryption. See [Client configuration](/docs/sdk/csharp/guide#client-configuration) for the full reference.

## Quick start

These samples use the [High-level SDK](/docs/sdk/csharp/high-level-sdk) - the recommended way to build producers and consumers. For the equivalent low-level, per-call flow, see the [Guide](/docs/sdk/csharp/guide).

### Producer

```csharp
using System.Text;
using Apache.Iggy;
using Apache.Iggy.Configuration;
using Apache.Iggy.Enums;
using Apache.Iggy.Extensions;
using Apache.Iggy.Factory;
using Apache.Iggy.Messages;

var client = IggyClientFactory.CreateClient(new IggyClientConfigurator
{
    BaseAddress = "127.0.0.1:8090",
    Protocol = Protocol.Tcp
});

await client.ConnectAsync();
await client.LoginUserAsync("iggy", "iggy");

var publisher = client.CreatePublisherBuilder(
        Identifier.String("sample-stream"),
        Identifier.String("sample-topic"))
    .CreateStreamIfNotExists("sample-stream")
    .CreateTopicIfNotExists("sample-topic")
    .Build();

await publisher.InitAsync();

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    var payload = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"message-{i}");
    await publisher.SendMessagesAsync(new List<Message> { new(Guid.NewGuid(), payload) });
}

await publisher.DisposeAsync();
```

### Consumer

```csharp
using System.Text;
using Apache.Iggy;
using Apache.Iggy.Configuration;
using Apache.Iggy.Consumers;
using Apache.Iggy.Enums;
using Apache.Iggy.Extensions;
using Apache.Iggy.Factory;
using Apache.Iggy.Kinds;

var client = IggyClientFactory.CreateClient(new IggyClientConfigurator
{
    BaseAddress = "127.0.0.1:8090",
    Protocol = Protocol.Tcp
});

await client.ConnectAsync();
await client.LoginUserAsync("iggy", "iggy");

var consumer = client.CreateConsumerBuilder(
        Identifier.String("sample-stream"),
        Identifier.String("sample-topic"),
        Consumer.New(1))
    .WithPollingStrategy(PollingStrategy.Next())
    .WithAutoCommitMode(AutoCommitMode.AfterReceive)
    .Build();

await consumer.InitAsync();

await foreach (var message in consumer.ReceiveAsync())
{
    var payload = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(message.Message.Payload);
    Console.WriteLine($"Offset {message.CurrentOffset}: {payload}");
}
```

`ReceiveAsync` polls **indefinitely** - pass a `CancellationToken` or `break` out of the loop to stop.
