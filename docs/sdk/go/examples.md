# Examples

> Runnable Go examples from the core repository, and how to start a server they can connect to.

A runnable getting-started example lives in the [examples/go](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/examples/go) directory of the core repository. Its `go.mod` carries a `replace` directive pointing at the in-repo SDK, so the example always builds against the SDK source in the same checkout. The examples are exercised in CI via `scripts/run-examples-from-readme.sh --language go`.

## Starting the server

The Go SDK speaks the VSR (Viewstamped Replication) wire protocol, so the examples run against the VSR server. The examples log in as `iggy`/`iggy`, and root credentials are applied **only on the very first startup**, when no data directory exists yet. Start the server with the default root credentials:

```bash
cargo run --bin iggy-server -- --fresh --with-default-root-credentials
```

If an example fails to log in, the server data directory (`local_data` by default) was created with different credentials: delete it and start the server again with the defaults. This setup is intended only for development and testing.

## Getting started

The [producer](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/examples/go/getting-started/producer/main.go) creates `sample-stream` and `sample-topic` (if missing) and sends 5 batches of 10 messages to partition `0`. The [consumer](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/examples/go/getting-started/consumer/main.go) polls them from offset `0` and exits after 5 batches. Stream, topic, and partition IDs are **0-based**.

Run both from the `examples/go` directory:

```bash
go run ./getting-started/producer/main.go
go run ./getting-started/consumer/main.go
```

Run multiple producers and consumers at once to see how messages are distributed across clients.

Both binaries accept the same flags:

- `--tcp-server-address` - server address, default `127.0.0.1:8090`
- `--tls` - enable TLS
- `--tls-ca-file` - path to a CA certificate file
- `--tls-domain` - TLS server domain name for SNI

## TLS

Start the server with TLS enabled, using the development certificates from the repository:

```bash
IGGY_TCP_TLS_ENABLED=true \
IGGY_TCP_TLS_CERT_FILE=core/certs/iggy_cert.pem \
IGGY_TCP_TLS_KEY_FILE=core/certs/iggy_key.pem \
cargo run --bin iggy-server
```

Then run the examples with the TLS flags (paths relative to `examples/go`):

```bash
go run ./getting-started/producer/main.go --tcp-server-address localhost:8090 --tls --tls-ca-file ../../core/certs/iggy_ca_cert.pem
go run ./getting-started/consumer/main.go --tcp-server-address localhost:8090 --tls --tls-ca-file ../../core/certs/iggy_ca_cert.pem
```

For the code walkthrough, see the [quick start](/docs/sdk/go/intro#quick-start) on the intro page, which follows the same example.
