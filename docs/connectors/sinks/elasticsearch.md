The Elasticsearch sink connector consumes messages from Iggy streams and indexes them into an Elasticsearch index using the bulk API.

## Configuration

```toml
type = "sink"
key = "elasticsearch-sink"
enabled = true
version = 1
name = "Elasticsearch Sink"
path = "/path/to/libiggy_connector_elasticsearch_sink.so"

[[streams]]
stream = "events"
topics = ["logs"]
schema = "json"
batch_length = 100
poll_interval = "5ms"
consumer_group = "elasticsearch-sink"

[plugin_config]
url = "http://localhost:9200"
index = "events"
username = "elastic"
password = "changeme"
create_index_if_not_exists = true
```

### Plugin config options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `url` | string | required | Elasticsearch cluster URL |
| `index` | string | required | Target index name |
| `username` / `password` | string | none | Optional basic authentication credentials |
| `create_index_if_not_exists` | bool | `true` | Create the index on startup when it is missing |
| `index_mapping` | table | none | Body of the create-index request (mappings, settings) |
| `batch_size` | integer | unused | Accepted but currently not read by the connector |
| `timeout_seconds` | integer | unused | Accepted but currently not read by the connector |

The stream-level `batch_length` governs batching: each consume cycle bulk-indexes the batch of messages it receives. The connector performs no retries of its own. Failed batches are logged and counted.

### Index mapping

`index_mapping` is sent verbatim as the body of the create-index request, so it must be a structured object, not a JSON string embedded in TOML. Express it as nested TOML tables:

```toml
[plugin_config.index_mapping.mappings.properties.timestamp]
type = "date"

[plugin_config.index_mapping.mappings.properties.message]
type = "text"

[plugin_config.index_mapping.mappings.properties.service_name]
type = "keyword"

[plugin_config.index_mapping.mappings.properties.level]
type = "keyword"
```

## Payload handling

- JSON payloads are indexed as documents directly.
- Raw payloads are parsed as JSON when possible, and wrapped as `{ "data": "<base64>", "data_type": "raw" }` when that fails.
- Text payloads are wrapped as `{ "text": "...", "data_type": "text" }`.
- Other payload formats are skipped with a warning.

Each document is enriched with metadata fields before indexing: `_iggy_offset`, `_iggy_stream`, `_iggy_topic`, `_iggy_partition`, `_iggy_timestamp`, and `_iggy_headers` (when headers are present).
