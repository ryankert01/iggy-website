**Benchmarks should be the first-class citizens**. We believe that performance is crucial for any system, and we strive to provide the best possible performance for our users. Please check, why we believe that the **[transparent benchmarking](https://iggy.apache.org/blogs/2025/02/17/transparent-benchmarks)** is so important.

We've also built the **[benchmarking platform](https://benchmarks.iggy.apache.org)** where anyone can upload the benchmarks and compare the results with others. This is the another open-source project available [here](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/bench/dashboard).

![Benchmarking Platform](/img/bench_platform.png)

Iggy comes with a built-in benchmarking tool, `iggy-bench`. It's written in Rust and uses the `tokio` runtime for asynchronous I/O, mimicking the example client applications, so you can use it to estimate the performance of the server in your environment. It is part of the [core repository](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/bench) and lives in the `core/bench` directory.

## Running benchmarks

First build the project in release mode:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

**`iggy-bench` doesn't start a server.** It only connects, and fails with a connection error when nothing is listening. For a disposable development server with an empty data directory, use the credentials expected by the benchmark defaults:

```bash
cargo run --bin iggy-server -r -- --with-default-root-credentials
```

This flag affects only the first creation of the root user; existing credentials remain unchanged, and environment variables take precedence. For another server, pass its credentials with `iggy-bench -u USER -p PASSWORD` before the benchmark kind.

The repo's driver script builds, starts the server, runs a send and a poll benchmark, and shuts the server down. **Use it only in a disposable checkout on an isolated host: it deletes `local_data` and signals matching `iggy-server` and `iggy-bench` processes by name.**

```bash
./scripts/run-benches.sh
```

With a server running, invoke the benchmark kind and transport of your choice. Workloads that produce create their benchmark streams and topics, deleting pre-existing `bench-stream-{n}` streams unless `--reuse-streams` is set. Consumer-only workloads (`pc` and `bcg`) require those streams and enough messages to exist already. Run the corresponding producer workload first, with matching stream, partition, and message counts.

## Benchmark kinds

Eight kinds are available, each with a short alias:

Producer and consumer counts default to six. Pinned workloads also default to six streams. Set explicit counts to match the workload and available CPUs.

1. Pinned producer (`pp`): N producers, each sending to its own stream-topic with a single partition:

   ```bash
   cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- pinned-producer tcp
   ```

2. Pinned consumer (`pc`): N consumers, each polling its own stream-topic with a single partition:

   ```bash
   cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- pinned-consumer tcp
   ```

3. Pinned producer and consumer (`ppc`), in parallel:

   ```bash
   cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- pinned-producer-and-consumer tcp
   ```

4. Balanced producer (`bp`): N producers sending to M partitions in K streams with balanced partitioning:

   ```bash
   cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- balanced-producer tcp
   ```

5. Balanced consumer group (`bcg`): N consumers assigned to M consumer groups polling from K partitions:

   ```bash
   cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- balanced-consumer-group tcp
   ```

6. Balanced producer and consumer group (`bpcg`), in parallel:

   ```bash
   cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- balanced-producer-and-consumer-group tcp
   ```

7. End-to-end producing consumer (`e2e`): each task produces and then consumes its own messages, measuring the full round trip:

   ```bash
   cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- end-to-end-producing-consumer tcp
   ```

8. End-to-end producing consumer group (`e2ecg`): N producing consumers assigned to M consumer groups:

   ```bash
   cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- end-to-end-producing-consumer-group tcp
   ```

## Transports

The transport subcommands are `tcp`, `quic`, `http`, and `websocket` (alias `ws`). Consumer-group workloads (`bcg`, `bpcg`, and `e2ecg`) require a binary transport: HTTP consumer-group joining returns `FeatureUnavailable`, even though the benchmark CLI accepts that combination. Each transport subcommand takes `--server-address` for a non-default server, for example:

```bash
cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- pinned-producer tcp --server-address 127.0.0.1:8090
```

Message count, batch size, message size, and both durability flags precede the kind subcommand. Producer, consumer, stream, and partition counts belong to the selected kind. `iggy-bench --help` and `iggy-bench examples` show the full surface.

## Storing and comparing results

Each transport subcommand accepts a trailing `output` subcommand that persists the run (raw JSON data and charts):

```bash
cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- pinned-producer tcp output -o performance_results --identifier my-host
```

`-o/--output-dir` defaults to `performance_results`. Optional flags (`--remark`, `--gitref`, extra info) annotate the run. You can inspect persisted results with the in-repo report and runner crates (`core/bench/report`, `core/bench/runner`), and browse or compare them in the dashboard (`core/bench/dashboard`), which also powers the public [benchmarking platform](https://benchmarks.iggy.apache.org). A prebuilt dashboard image is available: `docker pull apache/iggy-bench-dashboard`.

## Performance

The server is thread-per-core and shared-nothing, built on `io_uring` (via `compio`), with shard and CPU pinning configurable under `[sharding]`. Throughput and latency depend heavily on hardware, transport, and payload shape (`messages-per-batch * message-size`). Run the benchmarks on your own hardware, or browse current, dated results on the [benchmarking platform](https://benchmarks.iggy.apache.org).

## Prepare the host and topic policies

Use the [Linux tuning guide](/docs/server/linux-tuning) to check process limits, swap, huge pages, CPU/NUMA placement, writeback, and network capacity before measuring. Record the exact host settings and change one variable at a time. Use a separate load generator, or disjoint CPU sets when it shares a host with the server.

`--durability` and `--consumer-offset-durability` independently default to `replicated`. Place them before the benchmark kind. For example, this keeps consumer offsets replicated while measuring persisted message acknowledgments:

```bash
cargo r --bin iggy-bench -r -- --durability persisted balanced-producer-and-consumer-group tcp
```

Add `--consumer-offset-durability persisted` to request that policy too. These are create-time options and have no effect on existing topics with `--reuse-streams`. Poll auto-commit remains asynchronous, so poll latency is not an acknowledged offset-store measurement. `iggy-bench examples` shows all benchmark kinds, transports, policy combinations, and available topic-option examples.

Keep both policies, replication-group size, batch and message sizes, CPU allocation, and storage consistent between runs. Run long enough to include flushes and checkpoints, and report tail latency, errors, memory pressure, and client utilization alongside throughput.
