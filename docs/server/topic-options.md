Retention, durability, and segment layout are per-topic decisions, made when the topic is created. They used to be server-wide `[system.*]` keys, which gave every knob two homes. The server now [refuses to boot](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/configuration#relocated-configuration-keys) on the old keys, and each topic carries its own values instead.

Options are key-value pairs sent with `CreateTopic`. Unknown keys are **rejected at the edge, never skipped**: a silently ignored knob would leave the client on server defaults with no way to find out. The same mechanism exists for streams and users, but their catalogs are empty today. Only topics have option keys.

## The catalog

| Option | Default | Constraints | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `max_topic_size` | unlimited | finite values at least `segment_size` | Per-partition limit on sealed segment bytes. Delete the oldest sealed segments once that partition exceeds it. |
| `message_expiry` | none | | Delete the oldest sealed segments whose newest message timestamp is older than this duration. |
| `compression_algorithm` | `none` | `none` or `gzip` | Placeholder: stored and reported, no compression applied yet. |
| `segment_size` | 1 GiB | 0 selects the default; otherwise a 512-byte multiple from 1 MiB through 1 GiB | Soft size limit per segment: a segment may close one whole batch past it. |
| `durability` | `replicated` | `replicated` or `persisted` | Message completion policy. `persisted` requires recoverable stable-storage copies at the replication quorum before success. |
| `consumer_offset_durability` | `replicated` | `replicated` or `persisted` | Completion policy for explicit consumer-offset stores and deletes, independent of message durability. |
| `messages_required_to_save` | 1024 | non-zero, at most 16777216 | Flush the journal once it holds this many messages. |
| `size_of_messages_required_to_save` | 1 MiB | 0 selects the default; at most 1 GiB | Flush the journal once it holds this many bytes. Paired with the message count; whichever threshold trips first flushes. |
| `preallocate_segments` | `false` | `segment_size` x partitions at most 64 GiB per create | Reserve each segment's bytes up front where the filesystem supports it. |

Both retention policies can be active at once. The active segment is **never touched**, and its bytes are excluded from the size limit. A segment whose end offset exceeds the lowest stored consumer or consumer-group offset is retained; with no stored offsets, this barrier is absent. Deletion is done by the server's segment cleaner (`[data_maintenance.messages]`, enabled by default).

Both durability policies write data to disk and default independently to `replicated`. Neither inherits the other. Flush thresholds schedule ordinary segment writes; required persistence, capacity pressure, or lifecycle operations can flush earlier. They do not weaken the `persisted` completion guarantee.

Value forms are forgiving: byte sizes accept a raw number of bytes or a string like `"128 MiB"`, expiry accepts microseconds or a humantime string like `"7 days"`, booleans accept `true`/`false`. Create admission re-parses and re-encodes what you send, so a string `segment_size=128MiB` is stored as the number it names.

`preallocate_segments` requests a `segment_size` reservation for each partition's segment file when it is opened, including during topic creation and rotation. On Linux this reserves disk space without changing the file's logical length. Unsupported or failed reservations log a warning and fall back to ordinary allocation. With the default 1 GiB segment size, the request is 1 GiB per partition up front, which is why it's opt-in and why one create is **capped at 64 GiB** of requested reservation.

## Setting options

At creation, every interface takes the same keys:

```bash
# CLI: --set is repeatable. Positional arguments: stream, name,
# partitions count, compression algorithm.
iggy topic create my-stream my-topic 1 none \
  --set segment_size=128MiB \
  --durability persisted \
  --consumer-offset-durability persisted
```

In the CLI, both durability policies have named flags. `--set` is repeatable and covers other storage options, such as `segment_size`. `compression_algorithm`, `message_expiry`, and `max_topic_size` also have first-class parameters. Run `iggy options topic` to discover what the server accepts.

SDKs expose typed durability values in their topic creation options. In Rust, set `TopicCreateOptions::durability` and `TopicCreateOptions::consumer_offset_durability` to `Durability::Replicated` or `Durability::Persisted`. The HTTP API takes `"durability"` and `"consumer_offset_durability"` as string values in the create body's `options` map.

Keys absent from the wire request are resolved by the admitting server and stored as **derived** entries. Typed SDKs can send their default durability values explicitly. Binary `GetTopic` responses carry explicit and derived blocks; HTTP reports an `explicit` flag per option. Both report option values and the provenance of the request. See the update limitation below.

## Create-only vs updatable

**Only three options** can change after creation, via `UpdateTopic`:

- `compression_algorithm`
- `message_expiry`
- `max_topic_size`

Updates are **patches**: a key you don't send keeps its current value.

The storage options (`segment_size`, `durability`, `consumer_offset_durability`, `messages_required_to_save`, `size_of_messages_required_to_save`, `preallocate_segments`) are **create-only**. A topic gets them at creation and keeps them. `UpdateTopic` rejects changes to either durability policy, so select both before creating the topic.

An update that explicitly sends `server_default` (zero) for `message_expiry` or `max_topic_size` has inconsistent reporting: the server retains the previous fixed response fields but stores zero in the corresponding option entries. The CLI sends these sentinels when those update arguments are omitted. Supply explicit expiry and size values when updating a topic; do not rely on zero to reset or preserve its retention settings.

## Discovering the catalog

Ask the server which keys it accepts, with their types, defaults, and descriptions:

```bash
iggy options topic
```

For HTTP, set `IGGY_TOKEN` to a valid JWT or personal access token:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $IGGY_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/options/topic
```

The Rust SDK exposes the same call as `describe_options`. The scope is `topic`, `stream`, or `user`.

Discovery matters most on the binary transports: TCP, QUIC, and WebSocket carry **only an error code** for a rejected key, not its name, so the catalog is how a client finds out what this server supports. Over HTTP the error message names the offending key directly.

## Durability

`replicated` waits for quorum commit and application without an additional stable-storage barrier. `persisted` also requires recoverable stable-storage copies at the required quorum. On a single node that means recoverable local persistence before success; in a cluster it uses durable prepare history. Setting `messages_required_to_save=1` is not required for `persisted`.

The former `enforce_fsync` option is rejected. Use `durability` for messages and `consumer_offset_durability` for explicit offset changes. Poll auto-commit remains asynchronous, and HTTP `ack=none` confirms dispatch only, regardless of these policies.

See [Durability](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/durability) for single-node failure behavior and [Cluster Durability](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/clustering/durability) for the quorum and WAL guarantees.
