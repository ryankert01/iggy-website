Apache Iggy replicates clusters with **Viewstamped Replication Revisited (VSR)**. VSR keeps an ordered state machine consistent across replicas and elects a new primary when the current primary fails.

Clustering is built into the standard `iggy-server` binary. There's **no separate build, binary, or Cargo feature**: the same server runs single-node or clustered, and `cluster.enabled` in the configuration decides which one you get. Clustering is **disabled by default**.

Read the [VSR paper used by the project](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/assets/vsr.pdf) for the protocol specification.

> Iggy hasn't reached a 1.0 production release yet. The cluster protocol and configuration described here can still change between pre-release versions.

## Current implementation

The implementation includes:

- normal operation with quorum commits
- view changes and deterministic primary selection
- metadata and partition replication
- persistent WAL recovery and snapshots
- replica rejoin with journal repair
- client sessions, request fencing, and duplicate detection
- replica authentication and optional TLS
- leader redirection in the client SDKs
- deterministic simulation and cross-SDK BDD coverage

The main components are:

| Component | Source | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server | [`core/server`](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/server) | Sharded runtime, listeners, recovery, and request dispatch |
| Consensus | [`core/consensus`](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/consensus) | VSR state machine, quorum, view changes, and timeouts |
| Wire protocol | [`core/binary_protocol/src/consensus`](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/binary_protocol/src/consensus) | Fixed-size VSR headers and replica messages |
| Simulator | [`core/simulator`](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/simulator) | Deterministic failures, delays, and network partitions |
| Rust SDK | [`core/sdk`](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/sdk) | VSR framing, sessions, retries, and leader redirection |

## Replication model

Iggy splits replication by namespace:

| Plane | Consensus group | Replicated work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata | One group on shard 0 | Streams, topics, users, permissions, consumer groups, and access tokens |
| Partition | One group per partition | Messages and consumer offsets |

Each group can have a *different* primary. Metadata writes route through the metadata primary. Partition writes route through the primary for that partition.

Reads use the local replicated state where possible. Writes return after the required VSR commit or return a retryable error when the replica is changing view or catching up. See [Client failover](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/clustering/client-failover) for how the SDKs handle both.

## Failure handling

VSR uses three main flows:

1. **Normal operation**: the primary assigns an operation number, sends `Prepare`, and commits after a quorum sends `PrepareOk`.
2. **View change**: replicas exchange `StartViewChange` and `DoViewChange`, then the new primary sends `StartView`.
3. **Recovery**: a restarted or lagging replica requests the current view and repairs missing WAL ranges before serving current state.

Three replicas tolerate one unavailable replica; five tolerate two. Larger groups use a capped replication quorum and a growing view-change quorum, so the usual `2f + 1` rule does not apply to every group size. See [Cluster durability](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/clustering/durability#what-an-acknowledgement-means) for the quorum rules. Use **at least three replicas** for one-node fault tolerance. A two-node cluster is useful for development, but it **cannot make progress** after either node fails.

## Wire protocol and SDKs

VSR framing is the *only binary* wire protocol, used by TCP, QUIC, and WebSocket connections. HTTP uses the REST API. Every SDK (Rust, Go, Java, C#, C++, Node.js, Python) speaks it, and every BDD suite runs against the clustered-capable `iggy-server`. Binary clients built before the VSR migration **cannot talk to current servers**.

The Rust SDK needs no feature flags. Depend on the published crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
iggy = "0.11.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

or track the repository directly with `iggy = { git = "https://github.com/apache/iggy" }`.

The client API is the same in single-node and cluster mode. This example uses the `iggy` / `iggy` credentials explicitly provisioned in [Getting started](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/introduction/getting-started):

```rust
use iggy::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), IggyError> {
    let client = IggyClientBuilder::from_connection_string(
        "iggy://iggy:iggy@127.0.0.1:8090",
    )?
    .build()?;

    client.connect().await?;

    let cluster = client.get_cluster_metadata().await?;
    println!("cluster: {}", cluster.name);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Status

VSR started as a parallel `server-ng` implementation behind a `vsr` build feature. That phase is over. The VSR server moved into the mainline `core/server` crate and the `iggy-server` binary, the feature flag is gone, and the legacy server and its wire format were deleted. What this page describes is the only server implementation.

- [Configuration](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/clustering/configuration): every `[cluster]` setting and its validation rules
- [Security](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/clustering/security): replica authentication, key rotation, and TLS
- [Client failover](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/clustering/client-failover): reads, writes, and leader redirection from the client side
