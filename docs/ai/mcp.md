The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. The Apache Iggy MCP Server is an implementation of the MCP protocol for the message streaming infrastructure. It is built using the `rmcp` crate and supports both **stdio** and **HTTP** transports.

## Getting started

To start the MCP server, simply run `cargo run --bin iggy-mcp`.

The [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iggy-mcp) is available, and can be fetched via `docker pull apache/iggy-mcp`.

## Configuration

The minimal viable configuration requires at least the Iggy credentials, used to create the TCP connection to the running Iggy server that the MCP server talks to. You can choose between HTTP (the default) and STDIO transports (e.g. for the local usage with tools such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) choose `stdio`).

```toml
transport = "http" # http (default) or stdio are supported

[iggy]
address = "localhost:8090" # TCP address of the Iggy server
username = "iggy"
password = "iggy"
# token = "secret" # Personal Access Token (PAT) can be used instead of username and password
# token = "file:/run/secrets/iggy_pat" # PAT can also be read from a file
# consumer = "iggy-mcp" # Optional consumer name

[iggy.tls] # Optional TLS configuration for the Iggy TCP connection
enabled = false
ca_file = "path/to/ca.pem"
domain = "" # Optional domain for TLS connection

[http] # Optional HTTP API configuration
address = "127.0.0.1:8082"
path = "/mcp"

[http.cors] # Optional CORS configuration for HTTP API
enabled = false
allowed_methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
allowed_origins = ["*"]
allowed_headers = ["content-type"]
exposed_headers = [""]
allow_credentials = false
allow_private_network = false

[http.tls] # Optional TLS configuration for HTTP API
enabled = false
cert_file = "core/certs/iggy_cert.pem"
key_file = "core/certs/iggy_key.pem"

[permissions]
create = true
read = true
update = true
delete = true

[telemetry] # Optional OpenTelemetry integration
enabled = false
service_name = "iggy-mcp"

[telemetry.logs]
transport = "grpc" # grpc or http
endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"

[telemetry.traces]
transport = "grpc" # grpc or http
endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"
```

The configuration file must be in the `toml` format. The path to the configuration can be overridden by `IGGY_MCP_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. Each setting can also be overridden by using the following convention `IGGY_MCP_<SECTION>_<KEY>` e.g. `IGGY_MCP_IGGY_USERNAME`, `IGGY_MCP_HTTP_ADDRESS` and so on. Environment variables can also be loaded from a dotenv file: point `IGGY_MCP_ENV_PATH` at the file, otherwise a `.env` file in the current working directory is loaded automatically.

The `token` value can be either a literal PAT or a `file:` reference such as `token = "file:/run/secrets/iggy_pat"`, in which case the token is read from the given file (`~` is expanded to the home directory).

## Permissions

The `[permissions]` section provides a first layer of access control, checked before any request is forwarded to the Iggy server. This lets you restrict the MCP server to read-only operations, for example:

```toml
[permissions]
create = false
read = true
update = false
delete = false
```

On top of this, the Iggy user account used by the MCP server has its own granular permissions. For production use, create a dedicated user with the minimum required permissions.

## Claude Desktop integration

Here's the example configuration to be used with Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iggy": {
      "command": "/path/to/iggy-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "IGGY_MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Docker

Run the MCP server as a container:

```bash
docker run -e IGGY_MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
  -e IGGY_MCP_HTTP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8082 \
  -e IGGY_MCP_IGGY_ADDRESS=iggy-server:8090 \
  -e IGGY_MCP_IGGY_USERNAME=iggy \
  -e IGGY_MCP_IGGY_PASSWORD=iggy \
  -p 8082:8082 \
  apache/iggy-mcp
```

The default HTTP address is `127.0.0.1:8082`, which inside a container is unreachable from the outside, so `IGGY_MCP_HTTP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8082` is required for the published port to work.

## Systemd integration

Build with the `systemd` cargo feature to enable systemd readiness and watchdog notifications:

```bash
cargo build --bin iggy-mcp --release --features iggy-mcp/systemd
```

The MCP server then behaves the same way the Iggy server does under systemd.
